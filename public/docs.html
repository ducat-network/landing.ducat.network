                        Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is the ecosystem of financial applications being built with blockchain technology. Essentially, DeFi is bringing conventional financial tools from CeFi (traditional centralized finance) on a blockchain. These DeFi tools are mostly built on open-source protocols or modular frameworks and SCPs (Smart Contract Platforms), such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos and etc. DeFi, being decentralized, is able to take advantages of operating on a public blockchain, such as censorship-resistance and unlimited access to on-chain financial infrastructure.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Decentralized Finance is non custodial (platforms don’t have custody of your assets — you do), composable (open-source code enables developers ability to build on top of others’ applications), open (defi networks are global, there are no borders in this financial system), transparent (the code for DeFi applications is open for anyone to see and inspect)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        DeFi has seen a 2000% growth in total amount of money participating in decentralized financial infrastructure over the last year. In September 2019 TVL (Total Value Locked) in DeFi was about 550 million USD. September 2020 marks new highs of 11 billion USD locked. This is 20x growth over the year.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So, what exactly are some of the primary DeFi sectors that are growing right now? Let’s look at some of the most popular — yield farming and decentralized lending protocols.

                        Yield farming is putting crypto assets to work and generating the most returns possible on those assets. A yield farmer (person participating in farming techniques within DeFi ecosystem) might move assets around within various DeFi projects offering returns (such as Compound, Synthetix, Uniswap, Yearn and so on) constantly chasing whichever pool and opportunity is offering the best APY (annual percentage yield) week to week or even day-to-day.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What makes yield farming gains so special are tokenized incentives. Tokenized incentive is when a new or existing DeFi project incentivizes user activity and proposes any yield farmer their own token in addition to the usual APY return. Incentivized yield farming rapidly grown in popularity and TVL in 2020, offering farmers implied yearly returns in thousands percentages for participating in risky DeFi pools. The market has normalized since then as of late 2020 with less risky projects in the space.

                        The biggest sector for decentralized finance is lending & borrowing crypto assets. Several high quality products have been built that allow users to borrow and lend directly on the blockchain with no intermediaries. Decentralized lending products are available to anyone, anywhere, and require only a wallet to use.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Lending: Crypto holders can lend on decentralized lending platforms to earn passive income on their holdings through interest fees paid by borrowers. This is an attractive option to lenders as they can earn relatively low risk interest on their existing holdings without entrusting their private keys to a 3rd party centralized service.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Borrowing: The dominant use case for borrowing crypto is margin trading. Borrowing allows traders to get leverage which multiplies gains and losses while trading, as well as short selling, a trading strategy which makes money when the price of an asset goes down. Currently, all relevant decentralized lending platforms use a form of borrowing called collateralized borrowing. Collateralized borrowing means that borrowers must lock up collateral of greater value than the value of their borrow. The collateral serves to ensure lenders will be repaid even if the borrower never repays the loan.

                        Ducat utilizes yield farming technique to distribute Ducat over the course of 1 year to Ducat and Ducat holders, as well as to Ducat Liquidity Providers. As outlined in 1.2 section of litepaper, Yield farming means putting crypto assets to work and generating returns on those assets. Ducat Yield Farms will allow users to put their Ducat (Ducat Token), and Ducat/ETH & Ducat/DOT (liquidity provider assets) to work to generate more Ducat, providing return on their assets in a decentralized form. The expected APY can not be calculated until market price and amount of locked assets participating in yield farming become known.

                        <br>
                        Ducat Yield Farming Breakdown:<br>
                        1 Million Ducat (10% of supply) is set aside for yield farming distribution.<br>
                        0.3 Million Ducat (3% of supply) will be available to farm by Ducat holders.<br>
                        0.6 Million Ducat (6% of supply) will be available to farm by Ducat/ETH and Ducat/DOT LPs.<br>
                        0.1 Million Ducat (1% of supply) will be available to farm by DOT holders.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To yield farm, token owners will have to deposit underlying assets into trustless smart contract and they will be able to claim their growing amount of rewards each block. Original plan of Ducat team is to enable Yield Farming process for 24 months, but the distribution may be slowed down or speeded up by token holders voting on community proposals within DucatDAO.

                        Vaults are smart contracts that continuously route your funds to utilize them with the best yield farming strategies and participate in the most profitable pools. DUCAT will launch Vaults where users can provide DUCAT, DOT and stablecoins in order to participate in the most profitable on-chain and cross-chain strategies to earn the most yield on their asset.
                        Vaults v1 (Delegated Staking): Initial on-chain DUCAT Vault will generate profit from delegated staking, which is estimated at 20% APY for DOT holders.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Vaults v2 (Cross-chain): DUCAT will launch Vaults on ETH blockchain where most of the profit-generating opportunities present right now. These ETH vaults will utilize yield farming, supplying funds to secure lending markets and stablecoins farming. Vault profits can be converted into ERC20 DUCAT and wrapped to the blockchain.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Vaults v3 (On-chain DeFi): With launch of DUCAT (such as Polkastarter) on the blockchain, profit can be generated by arbitrage opportunities and liquidity providing. These types of strategies will be utilized in third iteration of DUCAT Vaults.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        10 Million DUCAT (5% of total supply) is dedicated for vault incentives distribution, which means that aside from any yield generated from profitable vault strategies vault will also distribute DUCAT to vault stakers boosting their returns even more.

                        Ducat will launch Pokadot's first ever Lending Market smart contract and DApp to escalate DeFi growth on the chain. Ducat will utilize tried and trusted technologies from Compound and Aave (leading lending protocols on Ethereum) to launch Lending Market on Polkadot.

                        Lending market is a decentralized trustless autonomous application that allows you to borrow and lend crypto assets through a platform ruled by smart contracts. This is made possible thanks to a clever system of interest making pools, where users can supply and borrow cryptocurrencies. To borrow cryptocurrencies you have to first supply another one as a collateral for a loan. Lending market is one of the core components needed to grow DeFi ecosystem on Polkadot. As outlined in section 1.3 of this litepaper, the two core functionalities of Ducat lending market will be:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Lending: token holders can lend their decentralized assets on Ducat lending platform to earn passive income on their holdings through interest fees paid by borrowers. This is an attractive option to lenders as they can earn relatively low risk interest on their existing holdings on Polkadot chain without entrusting their private keys to a 3rd party centralized service.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Borrowing: Ducat lending platform will use collateralized borrowing, which means that borrowers must lock up collateral of greater value than the value of their borrow. The collateral serves to ensure lenders will be repaid even if the borrower never repays the loan.

                        Ducat is a utility governance token that has multiple use cases outlined below:<br><br>
                        1. Yield-Centric Token: Ducat will be at the core of yield generating processes of Ducat. All iterations of vaults, farms and lending markets from Ducat will have Ducat as a core token of a product. All vaults will have their rules set to buy Ducat using generated profits prior to distribution.<br>
                        2. Governance Voting Rights: Ducat contracts will be governed by Ducat Token. Ducat holders can negotiate and make relevant proposals to the benefit of the Ducat protocol. The voting proposals they submit must include clear voting options and plan. Then each community member is given a period of time to vote, and the result with a majority decision will be implemented. Holders of Ducat will have governance rights over important parts of Ducat protocols (such as financing terms of lending markets, yield farming distribution, vault strategies and everything else) through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization and proposals.<br>
                        3. Staking / Fees Redistribution Holders can participate in Ducat Staking. All Ducat vaults will have withdrawal fees on generated profits (0.3-1%). This portion of fees from Ducat generated yield strategies will be redistributed to Ducat Stakers.

                        DUCAT Mixer improves transaction privacy by breaking the chain of communication between sender and receiver addresses.
                        It uses a smart contract that accepts deposits in ETH that can be withdrawn from another address.
                        Whenever ETH is withdrawn to a new address, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit.
                        That's ensure complete privacy.<br>
                        In this way, DUCAT Mixer acts as a proxy to ensure that the transaction is 100% anonymous with zkSnarks proofs.
                        To make a deposit, the user generates a secret and sends their hash (called commitment) along with the deposit amount to
                        the DUCAT Mixer smart contract. The contract accepts the deposit and adds the commitment to its deposit list.
                        Later, the user decides to withdraw the money. To do so, the user must provide proof that he or she holds the secret of
                        the unspent commitment from the smart contract's deposit list.<br>
                        The zkSnark technology allows you to
                        do this without revealing which deposit corresponds to that secret. The smart contract will
                        verify the proof and transfer the deposited funds to the address specified for withdrawal.
                        An outside observer will not be able to determine which deposit this withdrawal comes from.
